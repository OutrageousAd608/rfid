# RFID Transmitter and Receiver
Exactly as the title reads, this device will act as both an RFID transmitter and receiver.

What would you do when...
1. You have too much money
2. So you have too many houses
3. So you have too many locked doors that all require different FOBS to open them

With this device you could carry around just a singular fob for all of them, let the magic do its thing!
